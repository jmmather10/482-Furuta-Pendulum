  # Introduction
The Furtua Pedulum otherwise known as the rotary inverted pendulum is a basic system to help exemplify a non-linear system that is have a rotary arm atteched to a sevro motor that rotates about the z-axis in the horizontal plane. Using centripital force the system is able to balance the pendulum arm that is attached to the end of the rotary arm in the upright position. Through utilizing this model the team will derive a state space representation of the model, apply this state space matricies in Matlab, output this system to Simulink, and connect the final result to Coppelia Sim in order to verify the result using a simulated model.
